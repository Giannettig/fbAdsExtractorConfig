##CONFIG DOCUMENTATION - CREDIT Marcus Wong, Keboola

# replace the account numbers on each row in the endpoint to the corresponding account number that you are trying to extract from
# on the first run, the extractor will create a new metadata bucket and table, do not delete it
# 
# endpoints - pretty self-explanatory
# fields - you can add there all the fields you want to download from API, list of fields can be found in documentation
# date_preset - describes for how long in history you want to download data
# time_increment - segmentation by days - can 1 to 90 - 1 means 1 row per day (**NOTE** THIS does not mean incremental writing into SAPI!) 
# by using {2:id} you can actually use parameters downloaded in other queries. The integer is ID of the row (rowID), then there is a field name. This means that for every id from query on row 2 download data.
# action_breakdowns - list of parameters on which you want to do group by 
# 
# **NOTE** FB Ads API apparently has a "feature" of not sending empty data. So in case you have no records for a given day it means there is nothing to show. I know, it sucks.
# For upgrading from older API to the new, you have to rename some of the endpoints. Very simple help is like this:
#   Change /adcampaign_groups to /campaigns
# Change /adcampaigns to /adsets
# Change /adgroups to /ads
# In the write path, change campaign_group_status, campaign_status, adgroup_status tostatus
# Source: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog
# Also, do not forget to change field names as described here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/v2.5_rename/v2.5
